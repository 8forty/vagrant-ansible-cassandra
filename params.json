The initial boot takes some time as Ansible has to download, install and configure DSE across each VM. Subsequent reboots are fast.\r\n\r\nDSE and Opscenter will be automatically configured and started once installed. They will also be automatically started each time the VMs are booted.\r\n\r\nNodes will be running on: ```192.168.56.10```, ```192.168.56.20```, ```192.168.56.30```\r\n\r\nOpscenter will be running on: ```192.168.56.40:8888```\r\n\r\nInstall the datastax-agents by entering ```vagrant``` for both the username and password.\r\n\r\nSSH into a node with: ```vagrant ssh <nodename>```\r\n\r\nShutdown the VMs: ```vagrant halt```\r\n\r\nResume VMs: ```vagrant up```\r\n\r\nDestroy the VMs (requires re-provisioning): ```vagrant destroy```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
